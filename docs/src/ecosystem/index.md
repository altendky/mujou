mujou converts images into patterns for kinetic sand tables.
This section catalogs the external landscape of devices, file formats, communities, and software tools that mujou serves and interoperates with.

The current scope is **kinetic sand tables** in the **consumer/hobby** market.
Support for pen plotters, laser cutters, vinyl cutters, and other CNC devices is deferred for future expansion.
