## Prompt

A photorealistic close-up of a single slender cherry blossom branch extending
diagonally from the upper left toward the center of the frame. Square format,
1:1 aspect ratio. The branch is crooked, gnarled, and twisted with angular bends
at each joint — old and weathered with rough, knotted bark and an irregular
zigzag shape. Two small clusters of pale pink blossoms sit near each other along
the middle section of the branch, separated by only a short gap. Bare twigs,
small buds, and empty spots where flowers have already fallen fill the rest of
the branch. Petals are detaching and scattering toward the lower right, tumbling
and drifting freely through the air. The camera is zoomed in tightly on the
branch so the blossoms and bark texture are large and detailed in the frame. No
trunk or large parent branch visible. The background is a bright, clean blue sky
with nothing else — no other branches, no foliage, no other objects anywhere in
the frame. The petals are a warm pink with enough saturation to stand out clearly
against the sky. Crisp, well-defined edges on the branch, blossoms, and every
petal. Natural daylight, shallow depth of field. Macro lens, high resolution, no
text, no watermarks, no vignette.
